> external grader engine for edx

**Warning:** Still in the experimental stage; may break at any moment.

## Install globally with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i -g gitbook2edx-external-grader
```

## General help 

```
Usage:
    gitbook2edx-external-grader serve [ -p PORT ] 
    gitbook2edx-external-grader run [ -e ENGINE ] [ -d | --dry ] CODE 
    gitbook2edx-external-grader -h | --help 

Options:
    -p, --port PORT       port to expose as a push endpoint for edx (def. 1666)
    -e, --engine ENGINE   engine to be used to run scripts ([octave, node])
    -d, --dry             dry run

Arguments:
    CODE                  the code to be executed; default: javascript

```

## Running

You can run the external grader in two configurations:

1. As a server 
2. As a command line tool to run jailed programs

### Running as a server

Simply invoking on the command line with `serve` starts the server listening on the specified port (default: 1666). At the moment, the grader has an app-armor profile for the following languages:

* Javascript (through NodeJS)

### Adding your own script engine 

TBD

#### Managing the server
To easily manage the server (optional), there are two npm scripts (`start` and `stop`) to make you run the grader in server mode and expose it to the internet. These scripts use `pm2` to start and stop both the grader and an `ngrok` server. The ngrok server should be configured with an `.ngrok` file; this is my `~/.ngrok` file:

```
auth_token: your auth token
tunnels:
    grader:
        subdomain: "grader.cms.zaccaria"
        proto:
            http: 1666
```

After `ngrok` started, the server is reachable in this case at: `http://grader.cms.zaccaria.ngrok.com`. This is the address to use for the Edx push `xqueue`.

# Development

## Tests

Tests are categorized in two parts:

1. Integration tests for the server part (via `supertest`); 
2. Command line execution: these test the sequencing of actions that should be done when launching an application through a confinement system (if it is available for your platform).
